# advent-of-code-2021

With this years Advent of code we shall attempt to create solutions in the other person's preferred language. (SNL Christmas Joke swap style)

I (Callum) will be attempting to solve the problems using Python, and Jack will attempt to use C#

I expect a lot of bad code but maybe some good lessons.
To any future employer, don't fire us.
